# Bola
HTTP Adaptive Streaming is a very popular technique for delivering media over the Internet. Several algorithms exist that try to optimize the quality given different constraints. Bola is an online control algorithm that adapts the bitrate as a utility maximization problem and uses Lyapunov optimization techniques to minimize rebuffering and maximize video quality.
